# Introduction

## Purpose

This Qualification Plan describes the approach that will be taken to ensure that the `$qual-system$' system is qualified for`$qual-use$' in accordance with applicable regulations and `$qual-client$' Standard Operating Procedures.
This plan  defines the scope of the qualification effort, a risk-based approach for qualification, required resources, and the quality assurance activities and deliverables that comprise this qualification effort.

Execution of the activities described in this plan will generate objective and documented evidence that`$qual-system$' is installed correctly and that it consistently functions as intended for the `$qual-use$`.

## Scope

This plan applies to `$qual-system$' as it will be implemented at`$qual-client$`for `$qual-use$'. This qualification of`$qual-system$' is overseen by `$qual-validation-sop$`.

### In Scope

An initial risk assessment has been carried out for `$qual-system$' to determine the areas of the system that are subject to validation (See`$qual-risk-assessment$`). In alignment with the findings reported in this assessment, the scope of this qualification effort is restricted to the `$qual-system$` functionality which is configured to satisfy the regulatory requirements at`$qual-client$` for its intended use.

`$qual-system$' will be interfaced with`$qual-interfaces$`. These interfaces are considered to be within the scope of this qualification effort, but validation of`$qual-interfaces$`are excluded from the scope of qualification.

### Out of Scope

Additional applications and business processes requiring interaction with `$qual-system$' must be assessed for regulatory impact and additional validation effort may be required prior to using any such interfaced applications and processes. Consequently, the following elements are excluded from the scope of this qualification effort:

 - Integrated third-party applications and/or solutions.  

 - Electronic and/or digital signatures.

 - Customizations that address specific business needs that are not related to 21 CFR Part 11, Subpart B – Electronic Records.

### Assumptions

# System Overview

## System Description

## System Architecture

`$qual-system-architecture$' ... '$Insert System Architecture Diagram or Reference to a System Description$`

## Environment

`$qual-client$`will maintain the following operating environments for `$qual-system$':
- Development – serves as a non-controlled site for developing configuration changes required for the system to meet business requirements.
- Test – serves as a controlled, pre-production environment for testing and training.
- Production – serves as a controlled operational environment for day-to-day activities.

# Validation Approach

`$qual-system$' is a `$qual-system-category$` and is considered to be a Category `$qual-gamp-category$` type system as defined in`$GAMP® 5$`. Qualification of`$qual-system$' for `$qual-use$' will be carried out in accordance with`$qual-sop$`following a risk-based approach.

The Validation Team will perform core qualification activities and generate the deliverables described below to support the qualification of`$qual-system$'.

## Risk Assessment

An Initial Risk Assessment has been carried out for `$qual-system$'for`$qual-use$' in `$qual-system$'(See`$qual-risk-assessment$`)In the assessment, regulations that the`$qual-system$' system must comply with have been identified. The assessment was used to determine which aspects of the system are subject to validation.

## Qualification Plan

The Qualification Plan (this document) outlines the approach, activities, responsibilities and deliverables for the qualification of `$qual-system$' with respect to 21 CFR Part 11 requirements for Electronic Records.

This document must be formally approved prior to the approval of any other qualification document(s) with the exception of the initial risk assessment, requirement specifications, and SOPs which may be approved prior to or in parallel with this plan.

## Requirements Specification

The Requirements Specification identifies business (end-user) requirements, functional requirements, and security requirements that are correlated to 21 CFR Part 11 requirements for Electronic Records. ...

## Functional Specification

## Installation Qualification

## Operational Qualification

## Traceability Matrix

The Requirements Traceability Matrix will serve as a tool for ensuring that specified requirements are met. This matrix will:
- Establish the relationship between requirements and the testing activities that demonstrate that the requirement is satisfied.
- Provide a cross-reference between requirements and the procedures or external controls that ensure that the requirement is satisfied.
- Provide justification for cases where no testing or verification is performed for a specific requirement.

## Qualification Summary Report

A Qualification Summary Report will be written at the conclusion of the project and will be approved prior to the system being released for use in Production. The Qualification Summary Report will:

- Summarize the entire qualification effort as well as its outcome.
- Discuss deviations, if any, from the original Qualification Plan for `$qual-use$' in`$qual-system$' (this document).
- Summarize the results of testing activities (IQ, OQ) and address all non-conformances encountered, their impact on the system, and any risk associated with using the system in Production.

Authorization for the release of `$qual-system$' for Production use will be obtained through the approval of the Qualification Summary Report.
